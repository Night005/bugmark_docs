II. A pleasant song or <b>dance;</b> the Pancratiast's
exercise, sports that thou art wont to be much taken with,
thou shalt easily contemn; if the harmonious voice thou
shalt divide into so many particular sounds whereof it doth
consist, and of every one in particular shall ask thyself;
whether this or that sound is it, that doth so conquer thee.
For thou wilt be ashamed of it. And so for shame, if
accordingly thou shalt consider it, every particular motion
and posture by itself: and so for the wrestler's exercise
too. Generally <b>then,</b> whatsoever it be, besides
virtue, and those things that proceed from virtue that thou
art subject to be much affected with, remember presently
thus to divide it, and by <b>this</b> kind of division, in
each particular to attain unto the contempt of the whole.
This thou must transfer and apply to thy whole life also.
