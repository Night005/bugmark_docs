XLII. <b>It</b> is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a
good effectual remedy against the fear of death, for a man
to consider in his mind the examples of such, who greedily
and covetously (as it were) did for a long time enjoy their
lives. What have they got more, than they whose deaths have
been untimely? Are not they themselves dead at the last? as
Cadiciant's, Fabius, Julianus Lepidus, or any other who in
their lifetime having buried many, were at the last buried
themselves. The whole space of any man's life, is but
little; and as little as it <b>is,</b> with what troubles,
with what manner of dispositions, and <b>in</b> the society
of how wretched a body must it be passed! Let it be
therefore unto thee altogether as a matter of indifferency.
For if thou shalt look backward; behold, what an infinite
chaos of time doth present itself unto thee; and as infinite
<b>a</b> chaos, if thou shalt look forward. <b>In</b> that
which is so infinite, what difference can there be between
that which liveth but three days, and that which liveth
three ages?
