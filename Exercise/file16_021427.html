XI. This day I <b>did</b> <b>come</b> out of all my trouble.
<b>Nay</b> <b>I</b> have cast out all my trouble; it should
rather be for that which troubled thee, whatsoever it was,
was not without anywhere that <b>thou</b> shouldest come out
of it, but within in thine own opinions, from whence it must
be cast out, before thou canst truly and constantly be at
ease.
