XXVII. Within a while the earth shall cover us all, and then
<b>she</b> herself shall have her change. <b>And</b> then
the <b>course</b> will be, from one period of eternity unto
another, and so a perpetual eternity. Now can any man that
shall consider with himself in his mind the several rollings
or successions of so many changes and alterations, and the
swiftness of all these rulings; can he otherwise <b>but</b>
contemn in his heart and despise all worldly things? The
cause of the universe is as it <b>were</b> a strong torrent,
it carrieth all away.
