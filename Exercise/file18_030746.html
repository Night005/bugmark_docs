from an obstinate and peremptory resolution of the mind,
violently and passionately set upon <b>Opposition,</b> as
Christians are wont; but from a peculiar judgment; with
discretion and gravity, so that <b>others</b> may be
persuaded also and drawn to the like example, but without
any noise and passionate exclamations.
