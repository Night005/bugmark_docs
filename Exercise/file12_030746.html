XXIV. What doest thou desire? To live long. What? To enjoy
the operations of a sensitive soul; or of the appetitive
faculty? or wouldst thou grow, and then decrease again?
<b>Wouldst</b> thou long be able to talk, to think and
reason with thyself? Which of all these <b>seems</b> unto
<b>thee</b> a worthy object of thy desire? Now if of all
these thou doest find that they be but little worth in
themselves, proceed on unto the last, which is, in all
things to follow God and reason. But for a man to grieve
that by <b>death</b> he shall be deprived of any of these
things, is both <b>against</b> God and reason.
