In Logic, the Stoic system is noteworthy for their theory as
to the test of truth, the Criterion. They compared the
new-born soul to a sheet of paper ready for <b>writing.</b>
Upon this the senses write their impressions, fantasias and
by experience of a number of these the soul unconsciously
conceives general notions koinai eunoiai or anticipations.
prolhyeis When the impression was such as to be irresistible
it was called (katalnptikh fantasia) one that holds fast, or
as they explained it, one proceeding from truth. Ideas and
inferences artificially produced by deduction or the like
were tested by this 'holding perception.' Of the Ethical
<b>application</b> I have already spoken. The highest good
was the virtuous life. Virtue alone is happiness, and vice
is unhappiness. Carrying this theory to its extreme, the
Stoic said that there could be no gradations between virtue
and vice, though of course each has its special
manifestations. Moreover, nothing is good but virtue, and
nothing but vice is bad. Those outside things which are
commonly called good or bad, such as health and sickness,
wealth and poverty, pleasure and pain, are to him
indifferent adiofora. All these things are merely the sphere
in which virtue may act. The ideal Wise Man is sufficient
unto himself in all things, autarkhs and knowing these
truths, he will be happy even when stretched upon the rack.
It is probable that no Stoic claimed for himself that he was
this Wise Man, but that each strove after it as an
<b>ideal</b> much as the Christian strives after a likeness
to Christ. The exaggeration in this statement was, however,
so obvious, that the later Stoics were driven to make a
further subdivision of things indifferent into what is
preferable (prohgmena) and what is undesirable. They also
held that for him who had not attained to the perfect
wisdom, certain actions were proper. (kaqhkonta) These were
neither virtuous nor vicious, but, like the indifferent
things, held a middle place. Two points in the Stoic system
deserve special mention. One is a careful distinction
between things which are in our power and things which are
not. Desire and dislike, opinion and affection, are within
the power of the will; whereas health, wealth, honour, and
other such are generally not so. The Stoic was called upon
to control his desires and affections, and to guide his
opinion; to bring his whole being under the sway of the will
or leading principle, just as the universe is guided and
governed by divine Providence. This is a special application
of the favourite Greek virtue of moderation, (swfrosuum) and
has also its parallel in Christian ethics. The second point
is a strong insistence on the unity <b>of</b> the universe,
and on man's duty as part of a great whole. Public spirit
was the most splendid political virtue of the ancient world,
and it is here made cosmopolitan. It is again instructive to
note that Christian sages insisted on the same thing.
Christians are taught that they are members of a worldwide
brotherhood, where is neither Greek nor Hebrew, bond nor
<b>free</b> and that they live their lives as fellow-workers
with God.
