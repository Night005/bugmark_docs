IX. Of Alexander the Platonic, not <b>often</b> nor without
great necessity <b>to</b> say, or to write to any man in a
letter, 'I am not at leisure'; nor in this manner
<b>still</b> to <b>put</b> off those <b>duties,</b> which we
owe to our friends and acquaintances (to every one in his
kind) under pretence of urgent affairs.
