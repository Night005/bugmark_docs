XXXVIII. <b>Either</b> all things by the providence of
reason happen unto every particular, as a part of one

the cause of all things and that life <b>be</b> nothing else
but an accidentary confusion of things, and death nothing
else, but a mere dispersion and so of all other things: what
doest thou trouble thyself <b>for?</b>
