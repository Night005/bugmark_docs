XI. Of things that are <b>external,</b> happen what will to
that which <b>can</b> suffer by external accidents. Those
things that suffer let them complain themselves, if they
will; as for me, as long as I conceive no such thing, that
that which is happened <b>is</b> evil, <b>I</b> have no
hurt; and it <b>is</b> in my power not to conceive any such
thing.
