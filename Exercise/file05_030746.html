By the irony of fate this man, so gentle and good, so
desirous of quiet <b>joys</b> and a mind free from care, was
set at the head of the Roman Empire when great dangers
threatened from east and west. For several years he himself
commanded his armies in <b>chief.</b> In camp before the
Quadi he dates the first book of his Meditations, and shows
how he could retire within himself amid the coarse clangour
of arms. The pomps and glories which he despised were all
<b>his;</b> what to most men is an ambition <b>or</b> a
dream, to him was a round of weary tasks which nothing but
the stern sense of duty could carry him through. And he did
his work well. His wars were slow and tedious, but
successful. With a statesman's wisdom he foresaw the danger
to Rome of the barbarian hordes from the north, and took
measures to meet it. As it was, his settlement gave two
centuries of respite to the Roman Empire; had he fulfilled
the plan of pushing the imperial frontiers to the Elbe,
which seems to have been in his mind, much more might
<b>have</b> been accomplished. But death cut short his
designs.
