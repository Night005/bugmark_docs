Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot <b>survive</b>
without wide spread public support and donations to carry
out its mission of <b>increasing</b> the number <b>of</b>
public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the
widest array of <b>equipment</b> including outdated
equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
<b>particularly</b> important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
