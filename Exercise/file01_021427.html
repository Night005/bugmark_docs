XXV. When <b>any</b> shall either impeach thee with false
accusations, or hatefully reproach thee, or <b>shall</b> use
any such carriage towards thee, get thee presently to their
minds and understandings, and look in them, <b>and</b>
behold what manner of men they be. Thou shalt see, that
there is no such occasion why it should trouble thee, what
such as they are think of thee. Yet must thou love them
still, for by nature they are thy friends. And the Gods
themselves, in those things <b>that</b> they seek from them
as matters of great moment, are <b>well</b> content, all
manner of ways, as by dreams and oracles, to help them as
well as others.
