XXXIV. As he that is bitten by a mad dog, is afraid of
everything almost that he seeth: so unto him, whom the
dogmata have once bitten, or in whom true knowledge hath
made an impression, everything almost that he sees or reads
be it never so short or ordinary, doth afford a good
memento; to put him out of all grief and fear, as that of
the poet, 'The winds blow upon the trees, and their leaves
fall upon the ground. Then do the trees begin to bud again,
and by the spring-time they put forth new branches. So is
the generation of men; some come into the <b>world,</b> and
others go out of it.' Of these leaves then thy children are.
And they also that applaud thee so gravely, or, that applaud
thy speeches, with that their usual acclamation, axiopistwz,
O wisely spoken I and speak well of thee, as on the other
side, they that stick not to curse thee, they that privately
and secretly dispraise and deride thee, they also are but
leaves. And they also that shall follow, in whose memories
the names of men famous after death, is preserved, they
<b>are</b> but leaves neither. For even <b>so</b> is it of
all these worldly things. Their spring comes, and they are
put forth. Then blows the wind, and they go down. <b>And</b>
then in lieu of them grow others out of the wood or common
matter of all things, like unto them. But, to endure but for
a while, is common unto all. Why then shouldest thou so
earnestly either seek <b>after</b> these things, or fly from
them, as though they should endure for ever? Yet a little
while, and thine eyes will be closed up, and for him that
carries thee to thy grave shall another mourn within a while
after.
