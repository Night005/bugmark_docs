XIV. Remember, that to change thy mind upon occasion, and to
follow him that is able to rectify thee, is equally
ingenuous, as to find out at the first, what is <b>right</b>
and just, <b>without</b> help. <b>For</b> of <b>thee</b>
nothing is required, ti, is beyond the extent of thine own
deliberation and jun. merit, and <b>of</b> thine own
understanding.
