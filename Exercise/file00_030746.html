XXXI. When thou seest Satyro, think of Socraticus and
Eutyches, or Hymen, and when Euphrates, think of Eutychio,
and Sylvanus, when Alciphron, of Tropaeophorus, when
Xenophon, of Crito, or Severus. And when thou doest look
upon thyself, fancy unto thyself some one or other of the
Caesars; and so for every one, some one or other that hath
been for estate and profession answerable unto him.
<b>Then</b> let this come to thy mind at the same time; and
where now are they all? Nowhere or anywhere? For so shalt
thou at all time be able to perceive how all worldly things
are but as the smoke, that vanisheth away: or, indeed, mere
nothing. Especially when thou shalt call to mind this
<b>also,</b> that whatsoever is once <b>changed,</b> shall
never <b>be</b> again as long as the world endureth. And
thou then, how long shalt thou endure? And why doth it not
suffice thee, if <b>virtuously,</b> and as becometh thee,
thou mayest pass that portion of time, how little soever it
be, that is allotted unto thee?
