X. If it were that thou hadst at one time both a stepmother,
and a natural mother living, thou wouldst honour and respect
her also; nevertheless to thine own natural mother would thy
refuge, and recourse be <b>continually.</b> So let the court
and <b>thy</b> philosophy be unto thee. Have recourse unto
<b>it</b> often, and comfort thyself in her, by whom it is
that those <b>other</b> things are made tolerable unto
<b>thee,</b> and thou also in those things not intolerable
unto others.
