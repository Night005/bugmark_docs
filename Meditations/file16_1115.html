XI. From my brother Severus, to be kind and loving to all
them of my house and family; by whom also I came to the
<b>knowledge</b> of Thrasea and Helvidius, and Cato, and
<b>Dio,</b> and Brutus. He it was also that did put me in
the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth,
administered by justice and equality; and of <b>a</b>
kingdom wherein should be regarded nothing more than the
good and welfare of the subjects. Of him also, to observe a
constant tenor, (not interrupted, with any other cares and
distractions,) in the study and esteem of philosophy: to be
bountiful and liberal in the largest measure; always to hope
the best; and to be confident that my friends love me. In
whom I moreover observed open dealing towards those
<b>whom</b> he reproved at any time, and that his friends
might without all doubt <b>or</b> much observation know what
he would, or would not, so open and plain was he.
