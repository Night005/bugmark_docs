When Marcus succeeded to the throne in 161, the letters
begin again, with slightly increased formality on Fronto's
part, and they go on for some four years, when Fronto, who
has been continually complaining of ill-health, appears to
have died. One letter of the later period gives some
interesting particulars of the emperor's public life, which
are worth quoting. Fronto speaks of Marcus's victories and
eloquence in the usual strain of high praise, and then
continues.(1) 'The army when you took it in hand was sunk in
luxury and <b>revelry,</b> and corrupted with long
inactivity. At Antiochia the soldiers had been Wont to
applaud at the stage plays, knew more of the gardens at the
nearest restaurant than of the battlefield. Horses were
hairy from lack of grooming, horsemen smooth because their
hairs had been pulled out by the roots(2) a rare
<b>thing</b> it was to see a soldier with hair on arm or
leg. Moreover, they were better drest than armed; so
<b>much</b> so, that Laelianus Pontius, a strict man
<b>of</b> the old discipline, broke the cuirasses of some of
them with his finger-tips, and observed cushions on the
horses' backs. At his direction the tufts were cut through,
and out of the horsemen's saddles came what appeared to be
feathers pluckt from geese. Few of the men could vault on
horseback, the rest clambered up with difficulty by aid of
heel and knee and leg not many could throw a lance hurtling,
most did it without force or power, as though they were
things of wool-dicing was common in the camp, sleep lasted
all night, or if they kept watch it was over the winecup.
<b>By</b> what regulations to restrain such soldiers as
these, and to turn them to honesty and industry, did you not
learn from Hannibal's sternness, the discipline of
Africanus, the acts of Metellus recorded in history.
