XVI. Remember that all is but opinion, and all opinion
depends <b>of</b> the <b>mind.</b> Take thine <b>opinion</b>
away, and then as a ship that hath stricken in within the
arms and <b>mouth</b> of the harbour, <b>a</b> present calm;
all things safe and steady: a bay, not capable of any storms
and tempests: as the poet hath it.
