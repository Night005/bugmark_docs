LIII. Wickedness in general doth not hurt the world.
Particular wickedness doth not hurt any other: only unto him
it <b>is</b> hurtful, whosoever he be that offends, unto
whom in great favour and mercy it is granted, that
whensoever he himself shall but first desire it, he may be
presently delivered of it. Unto my free-will my neighbour's
free-will, whoever he be, (as his life, <b>or</b> his bode),
is altogether indifferent. For though we are all made one
for another, yet have our minds and <b>understandings</b>
each of them their own proper and limited jurisdiction. For
else another man's wickedness might be my <b>evil</b> which
God would not have, that it might not be in another man's
power to make me unhappy: which <b>nothing</b> now can do
but mine own wickedness.
