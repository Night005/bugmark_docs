I. What is wickedness? <b>It</b> is that which many time and
often thou hast already <b>seen</b> and known in the world.
And so oft as anything doth happen that might otherwise
trouble thee, let this memento presently come to thy mind,
that it is that which thou hast already often Seen and
known. Generally, above and below, thou shalt find but the
same things. The very same things whereof ancient stories,
middle age stories, and fresh <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> full
whereof towns are full, <b>and</b> houses full. There is
nothing that is new. All things that are, are both usual and
of little continuance.
