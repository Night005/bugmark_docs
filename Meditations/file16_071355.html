XII. At the conceit and apprehension that such and such a
one hath sinned, thus reason with thyself; What do I know
whether this be a sin indeed, as it seems to be? But if it
be, what do I know <b>but</b> that he himself hath already
condemned himself for it? And that is all one as if a man
should scratch and tear his own face, an object of
compassion rather than of anger. Again, that he that would
not have a vicious man to sin, is like unto him that would
not have moisture in the <b>fig,</b> nor children to welp
nor a horse to neigh, nor anything else that in the course
of nature is <b>necessary.</b> For what shall he do that
hath such <b>an</b> habit? If <b>thou</b> therefore beest
powerful and eloquent, remedy it if thou canst.
