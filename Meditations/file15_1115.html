X. As several members in one <b>body</b> united, so are
reasonable <b>creatures</b> in a body divided and dispersed,
all made and prepared for one common <b>operation.</b> And
this thou shalt apprehend the better, if thou shalt use
thyself often to say to thyself, I am meloz, or a member of
the mass and body of reasonable substances. But if thou
shalt say I am meroz, or <b>a</b> part, thou dost not yet
love men from <b>thy</b> heart. The joy that thou takest in
the exercise of bounty, is not yet grounded upon a due
ratiocination and right apprehension of the nature of
things. Thou dost exercise it as yet upon this ground
barely, as a thing convenient and fitting; not, as doing
good to thyself, when thou dost good unto others.
