XXVI. Why should imprudent unlearned souls trouble
<b>that</b> which is both learned, and prudent? And which is
that that is so? she that <b>understandeth</b> the beginning
<b>and</b> the end, and hath the true knowledge of that
rational essence, that passeth through <b>all</b> things
subsisting, and through all ages being ever the same,
disposing and dispensing as it were this universe by certain
periods <b>of</b> time.
