XLI. Why should I grieve myself; who never did
<b>willingly</b> grieve any other! One thing rejoices one
and another thing another. As for me, <b>this</b> is my joy,
if my understanding be right and sound, as neither averse
from any man, nor refusing any of <b>those</b> things which
as a <b>man</b> I am subject unto; if <b>I</b> can look upon
all things in the world meekly and kindly; accept all things
and carry myself towards everything according to to true
worth of the thing itself.
