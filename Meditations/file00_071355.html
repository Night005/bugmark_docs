IV. Why should any of these things that happen externally,
so much <b>distract</b> thee? Give thyself leisure to learn
some <b>good</b> thing, and cease roving and wandering to
and fro. Thou must also take heed of another kind of
wandering, for they are idle in their <b>actions,</b>
<b>who</b> toil and labour in this life, and have no certain
scope to which to direct all their motions, and desires. V.
For not observing the state of another man's soul, scarce
was ever any man known to <b>be</b> unhappy. Tell whosoever
they be that intend not, and guide not by reason and
discretion the motions of their own souls, they must of
necessity be unhappy.
