XXIII. 'Where there shall neither roarer be, nor harlot.'
Why so? As thou dost purpose to live, <b>when</b> thou hast
retired thyself to some such place, where neither roarer nor
harlot is: so mayest thou here. And if they will not suffer
thee, then mayest thou leave thy life rather than thy
<b>calling,</b> but so as one that doth not think himself
anyways wronged. Only as one would say, Here is a smoke; I
will out of it. And what a great matter is this! Now till
some such <b>thing</b> force <b>me</b> out, I will continue
free; <b>neither</b> shall any man hinder me to do what I
will, and my will shall ever be by the proper nature of a
reasonable and sociable creature, regulated and directed.
