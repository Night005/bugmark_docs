XXIX. <b>If</b> this neither be my wicked act, nor an act
anyways depending from any wickedness of mine, and that by
it the public is not hurt; what doth it concern me? And
wherein can the public be hurt? For thou must <b>not</b>
altogether be carried by conceit and common opinion: as for
help thou must afford that unto them after thy best ability,
and as occasion shall require, though they sustain damage,
but in these middle or <b>worldly</b> things; but however do
not thou conceive that they are truly hurt thereby: for that
is not right. But as that old foster-father in the comedy,
being now to take his leave doth with a great deal of
ceremony, require his foster-child's rhombus, or rattle-top,
remembering nevertheless that it is but a rhombus; so here
also do thou likewise. For indeed what is <b>all</b> this
pleading and public bawling for at the courts? O <b>man,</b>
hast thou forgotten what those things are! yea but they are
things that others much care for, and highly esteem of. Wilt
thou therefore be a fool too? Once I was; let that suffice.
