XXXIII. Loss and corruption, is in <b>very</b> deed nothing
else but change and alteration; and <b>that</b> is it, which
the nature of the universe doth most delight in, by which,
and according to which, <b>whatsoever</b> is done, is well
done. For that was the estate of worldly things from the
beginning, and <b>so</b> shall it ever be. Or wouldest thou
rather say, that all things in the world have gone ill from
the beginning for so many ages, and shall ever go ill? And
then among so many deities, could no divine power be found
all this while, that could rectify the things of the world?
Or is the world, to incessant woes and miseries, for
<b>ever</b> condemned?
