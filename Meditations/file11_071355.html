XXVII. If in this kind of life thy body be able to hold out,
it is a shame that thy soul should faint first, and give
over, take heed, lest of a philosopher thou become a mere
Caesar in time, and receive a new tincture from the court.
For it may happen if thou <b>dost</b> not take heed. Keep
thyself therefore, truly simple, good, sincere, grave, free
from all ostentation, a lover <b>of</b> that which is just,
religious, <b>kind,</b> tender-hearted, strong and vigorous
to undergo anything that becomes thee. Endeavour to continue
such, <b>as</b> philosophy (hadst thou wholly and constantly
applied thyself unto it) would have made, and secured thee.
Worship the Gods, procure the welfare of men, this life is
short. Charitable actions, and a <b>holy</b> disposition, is
the only fruit of this earthly life.
