Middle things, Book 7, XXV. The <b>Stoics</b> divided all
things into virtue, vice, and indifferent things; but as
"indifferent" they regarded most of those <b>things</b>
which the world regards <b>as</b> good or bad, <b>such</b>
as wealth <b>or</b> poverty. Of these, some were "to be
desired," some "to be rejected."
