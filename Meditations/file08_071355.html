XXVIII. Thou mayest always speed, if thou wilt but make
choice of the right way; if in the course both of thine
opinions and actions, thou wilt observe a true method. These
two <b>things</b> <b>be</b> common to the souls, as of God,
so of men, and of every reasonable creature, first that in
their own proper <b>work</b> they cannot be hindered by
<b>anything:</b> and secondly, that their happiness doth
<b>consist</b> in a disposition to, and in the practice of
righteousness; and that in these their desire is terminated.
