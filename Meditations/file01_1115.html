XXVI. What art and <b>profession</b> soever thou hast
learned, endeavour to affect it, and <b>comfort</b> thyself
in it; and pass the remainder of thy life as one who from
his whole heart commits himself and <b>whatsoever</b>
belongs unto him, unto the gods: and as for <b>men,</b>
carry not thyself either tyrannically or servilely towards
<b>any.</b>
