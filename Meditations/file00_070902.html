XXVI. How Socrates looked, when <b>he</b> was fain to gird
himself with a skin, Xanthippe his wife having <b>taken</b>
away his clothes, and carried them abroad with her, and what
he said to his fellows and friends, who <b>were</b> ashamed;
and out of <b>respect</b> to him, did retire themselves when
they <b>saw</b> him thus decked.
