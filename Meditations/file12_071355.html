XVI. Whatsoever I am, is either flesh, or life, or that
which we commonly call the mistress and overruling part of
man; reason. Away with thy books, suffer not thy mind any
more to be distracted, and carried to and fro; for it will
not be; but as even now ready to die, think little of thy
flesh: blood, bones, and a skin; a pretty piece of knit and
twisted work, consisting of nerves, veins and arteries;
think no more of it, than so. And as for thy life, consider
what it is; a wind; not <b>one</b> constant wind neither,
but every moment of an <b>hour</b> let out, and sucked in
again. The third, is thy ruling part; and here consider;
Thou art an <b>old</b> man; suffer not that excellent part
to be brought in subjection, and to become slavish:
<b>suffer</b> it not to be drawn up and down with
unreasonable and unsociable lusts and motions, as it were
with wires and nerves; suffer <b>it</b> not any more, either
to repine at anything now present, or to fear and fly
anything to come, which the destiny hath appointed thee.
