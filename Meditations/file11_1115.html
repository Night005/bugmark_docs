XI. <b>When</b> <b>thou</b> art hard to be stirred up and
awaked out <b>of</b> thy sleep, admonish thyself and call to
mind, that, to perform actions tending to the common good is
that which thine own proper constitution, and that
<b>which</b> the nature of man do require. But to sleep, is
common to unreasonable creatures <b>also.</b> And what more
proper and natural, yea what more kind and pleasing, than
that which is according to nature?
