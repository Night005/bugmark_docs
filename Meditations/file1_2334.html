XVIII. Honour that which <b>is</b> chiefest and most
powerful in the world, and that is it, which makes use of
all <b>things,</b> and governs all things. So also in
thyself; honour that which is chiefest, and most powerful;
and is of one kind and nature with that which we now spake
of. For it is the very same, which being in thee, turneth
all other things to its own use, and by <b>whom</b> also thy
life is governed.
