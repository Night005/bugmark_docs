XIX. As one that tosseth up a ball. And what is a ball the
better, if the motion of it be upwards; or the worse if it
be downwards; or if it chance to fall upon the ground? So
for the bubble; if it continue, what it the better? and if
it dissolve, what is it the worse And so is it of a candle
too. And so must thou reason with thyself, both in matter of
fame, and in matter of death. For as for the body itself,
(the subject of death) wouldest thou know the vileness of
it? Turn <b>it</b> about that thou mayest behold it the
worst sides upwards as well, as in its more ordinary
<b>pleasant</b> shape; how doth it look, when it is old and
withered? when sick and pained? when in the act of lust, and
fornication? And as for fame. This life is short. Both he
that praiseth, and he that is praised; he that remembers,
and he that is remembered, will soon <b>be</b> dust and
ashes. Besides, it is but in one corner of this part of
<b>the</b> world that thou art praised; and yet in this
corner, thou hast not the <b>joint</b> praises of all men;
no nor scarce of any one constantly. And yet the whole earth
itself, what is it but as one point, in regard of the whole
world?
