XIII "Patient hearing... He would not" (16). C. translates
his conjectural reading epimonon ollan. on proapsth

<b>sense:</b> .....epimonon all antoi "Strict and rigid
dealing" (16). C. <b>translates</b> tonvn (Pal. MS.) as
though from tonoz, in the sense of "strain." "rigour." The
reading <b>of</b> other MSS. tonvn is preferable.
