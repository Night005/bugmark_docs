XXX. When thou art offended with any man's transgression,
presently reflect upon thyself; and consider what thou
thyself art guilty of in the same kind. As that thou also
perchance dost think it a happiness either to be rich, or to
live in <b>pleasure,</b> or to be praised and commended, and
so of the rest in particular. For this if thou shalt call to
mind, thou shalt soon forget thine anger; especially when at
the same time this also shall concur in thy thoughts, that
he was constrained by his error and ignorance so to
<b>do:</b> for how can he choose as long <b>as</b> he is
<b>of</b> that opinion? Do thou therefore if thou canst,
take away that from him, that forceth him <b>to</b> do as he
doth.
