But although Marcus Aurelius may have held intellectually
that his soul was destined to be absorbed, and to lose
consciousness of itself, <b>there</b> were times when he
felt, as all who hold it must sometimes feel, how
unsatisfying is such a creed. Then he gropes blindly after
something less empty and vain. 'Thou hast taken ship,' he
says, 'thou <b>hast</b> sailed, thou art come to land, go
out, if to another life, there also shalt thou find gods,
who are everywhere.' There is more in this than the
assumption of a rival theory for argument's sake. If worldly
things 'be but as a dream, the thought is not far off that
there may be an awakening to what is real. When he speaks of
death as a <b>necessary</b> change, and points out that
nothing useful and profitable can be <b>brought</b> about
without change, did he perhaps think of the change in a corn
of wheat, which <b>is</b> not quickened except it die?
Nature's marvellous power of recreating out of Corruption is
surely not confined to bodily things. Many of his thoughts
sound like far-off echoes of St. Paul; and it is strange
indeed that this most Christian of emperors has nothing good
to say of the Christians. To him they are only sectaries
'violently and passionately set upon opposition.
