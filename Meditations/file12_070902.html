Stoics, a philosophic system founded by Zeno <b>(4th</b>
century B.C.), and systematised by Chrysippus (3rd century
B.C.). Their physical theory was <b>a</b> pantheistic
materialism, their summum bonum "to <b>live</b>
<b>according</b> to nature." Their wise man needs
<b>nothing,</b> he is sufficient to himself; virtue is good,
vice bad, external things indifferent.
