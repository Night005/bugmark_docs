L. Will either passengers, or patients, find <b>fault</b>
and complain, either the one if <b>they</b> be well carried,
or the <b>others</b> if well cured? Do they take care for
any more than this; the one, that their shipmaster may
<b>bring</b> them safe to land, and the other, <b>that</b>
their physician may effect their recovery?
