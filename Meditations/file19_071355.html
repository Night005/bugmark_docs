Cynics, <b>a</b> school of philosophers, founded by
Antisthenes. <b>Their</b> texts were a kind of caricature of
Socraticism. Nothing was good <b>but</b> virtue, nothing bad
but vice. The Cynics <b>repudiated</b> all civil and social
claims, and attempted to return to what they called a state
<b>of</b> nature. Many of them were very disgusting in their
manners.
