XXVI. What art and <b>profession</b> soever thou hast
learned, endeavour to affect it, and comfort thyself in it;
<b>and</b> pass the remainder of thy life as one <b>who</b>
from his whole heart commits himself and whatsoever belongs
unto him, unto the gods: and as for men, <b>carry</b> not
thyself either tyrannically <b>or</b> servilely towards any.
