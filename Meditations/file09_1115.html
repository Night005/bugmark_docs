XIV "Cajeta" (17). The passage is certainly corrupt. C.
spies a <b>reference</b> to Chryses praying by the sea-shore
in the Illiad, and supposes M. Aurelius to have done the
like. None of the emendations suggested is
<b>satisfactory.</b> At ยง XV. Book II. is usually reckoned
to <b>begin.</b> BOOK II III. "Do, soul" (6). If the
received reading be right, it must be sarcastic; but there
are several variants which show how unsatisfactory it is. C.
translates "en gar o <b>bioz</b> ekasty so par eanty", which
I do not understand. The sense required is: "Do not violence
to thyself, for thou hast not long to use self-respect. Life
is not (v. 1. so long for each, and <b>this</b> life for
thee is all but done."
