XXXII. In another man's mind and understanding thy evil
Cannot subsist, nor in any proper temper or distemper of the
natural constitution of thy body, which is but as it were
the coat or cottage of thy soul. <b>Wherein</b> then, but in
that <b>part</b> of thee, wherein the conceit, and
apprehension of any misery can subsist? Let <b>not</b> that
part therefore admit any such conceit, and then all is
<b>well.</b> Though thy body which is so near it should
either be cut or burnt, or suffer any corruption or
putrefaction, yet let that part to which it belongs to judge
of these, be still at rest; that is, let her judge this,
that whatsoever it is, that equally may happen to a wicked
man, <b>and</b> to a good man, is neither good nor evil. For
that which happens equally to him that lives according to
nature, and to him that doth not, is neither according to
nature, nor against it; and by consequent, neither good nor
bad.
