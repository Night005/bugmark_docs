XXVI. Up and down, from one age to another, go the ordinary
things of the world; being still the <b>same.</b> And either
of everything in particular before it come to pass, the mind
of the universe doth consider with itself <b>and</b>
deliberate: and if so, then submit for shame unto the
determination of such an excellent understanding: or once
for all it did resolve upon all things <b>in</b> general;
and since that whatsoever happens, happens by a necessary
consequence, and all things indivisibly in a manner and
inseparably hold one of another. In sum, either there is a
God, and then all is well; or if all things <b>go</b> by
chance and fortune, yet mayest <b>thou</b> use thine own
providence in those things that concern thee properly; and
then art thou well.
