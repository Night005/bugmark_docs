VI. Of Sextus, mildness and the pattern of a family governed
with paternal affection; and a purpose to live according to
<b>nature:</b> to be grave without affectation: to observe
carefully the several dispositions of my friends, not to
<b>be</b> offended with idiots, nor unseasonably <b>to</b>
set upon those that are carried with the vulgar opinions,
with the theorems, and tenets of philosophers: his
conversation being an example how a man might accommodate
himself to all men and companies; so that though his company
were sweeter and more <b>pleasing</b> than any flatterer's
cogging and fawning; yet was it at the same time most
respected and reverenced: who also had a proper happiness
and faculty, rationally and methodically to find out, and
set in order all necessary determinations and instructions
for a man's life. A man without ever the <b>least</b>
appearance of anger, or any other passion; able at the same
time most exactly to observe the Stoic Apathia, or
unpassionateness, and yet to be most tender-hearted: ever of
good credit; and yet almost without any noise, or rumour:
very learned, and yet making little show.
