LII. Not only now henceforth to have a <b>common</b>
<b>breath,</b> or to hold correspondency of breath, with
<b>that</b> air, that compasseth us about; but to have a
common mind, or to hold correspondency <b>of</b> mind also
with that rational substance, which compasseth all things.
For, that also is of itself, and of its own nature (if a man
can but draw it in as he should) everywhere diffused; and
passeth through all things, no less than the air doth, if
<b>a</b> man can but suck it in.
