XXIV. He is a true fugitive, that flies from reason, by
which men are sociable. <b>He</b> blind, who cannot see with
the eyes of his understanding. He poor, that stands
<b>in</b> need <b>of</b> another, and hath not in himself
all things needful for this life. He an aposteme of the
world, who by being discontented with <b>those</b> things
that happen unto him in the world, doth as it were
apostatise, and separate himself from common nature's
rational administration. For the same nature it is that
brings this unto thee, whatsoever it be, that first brought
thee into the world. He raises sedition in the city, who by
irrational actions withdraws his own soul from that one and
common soul of all rational <b>creatures.</b>
