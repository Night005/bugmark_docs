XXI. As thou thyself, whoever thou art, were made <b>for</b>
the perfection and consummation, being a member of it, of a
common society; so must every action of thine tend to the
perfection and consummation of a life that is truly
sociable. What action soever of thine therefore that either
immediately <b>or</b> afar off, <b>hath</b> <b>not</b>
reference to the common good, that is an exorbitant and
disorderly action; yea it is seditious; as one among the
people who from such and such a <b>consent</b> and unity,
should factiously divide and separate himself.
