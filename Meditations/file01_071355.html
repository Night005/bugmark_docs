XX. They will say commonly, Meddle <b>not</b> with many
things, if thou wilt live cheerfully. Certainly there is
nothing <b>better,</b> than for a <b>man</b> to confine
himself to necessary actions; to such and so many only, as
reason in a creature that knows itself born for society,
will command and enjoin. This will not only procure that
cheerfulness, which from the goodness, but that also, which
from the paucity of actions doth usually proceed. For since
it is so, that most of those things, which we either speak
or do, are unnecessary; if a man shall cut them off, it must
needs follow that he shall <b>thereby</b> gain much leisure,
and save much trouble, and therefore at every action a man
must privately by way of <b>admonition</b> suggest unto
himself, What? may not this that now I go about, be of the
number of unnecessary actions? Neither must he use himself
to cut off actions only, but thoughts and imaginations also,
that are unnecessary for so will unnecessary consequent
actions the better be prevented and cut off.
