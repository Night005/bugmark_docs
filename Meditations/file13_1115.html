XXVI. How Socrates looked, <b>when</b> he was fain to gird
<b>himself</b> with a skin, Xanthippe <b>his</b> wife having
taken away his clothes, and carried them abroad with her,
<b>and</b> what he said to his fellows and friends, who were
ashamed; and out of respect to him, did retire themselves
when they saw him <b>thus</b> decked.
